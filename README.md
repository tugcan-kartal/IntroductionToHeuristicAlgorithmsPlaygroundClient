# Heuristic Algorithms Execution Platform

## Overview
This project is a web-based platform built using **React** and **Vite**, designed to execute various heuristic optimization algorithms. Users can configure and add different optimization techniques to an execution list and analyze their performance.

## Features
- Supports multiple heuristic optimization algorithms
- Dynamic execution list configuration
- Fast and interactive UI using React with Vite
- Modular structure for easy integration of new algorithms

## Implemented Algorithms
The platform currently includes the following heuristic algorithms:
1. **African Vultures Optimization**
2. **Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm**
3. **Artificial Gorilla Troops Optimization**
4. **Equilibrium Optimization**
5. **Genetic Algorithm**

More algorithms can be added as needed.

## Installation
To run the project locally, use npm.
